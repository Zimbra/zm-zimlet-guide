# Zimlets 101
## _Write your first Zimlet for Zimbra 9/Cloud_

There are now 2 versions of this guide a simple one and an advanced one. The simple one is written so that it is easier to understand if you do not have React knowledge or are a Javascript beginner. The advanced guide will teach you how to make Zimlets to perform a little better and have a lower risk of creating memory leaks. Some of our future guides are based on the simple Zimlet and others on the advanced Zimlets, so it is recommended you take a look at both if you have the time.
